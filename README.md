## 📌 Overview
Welcome to my **CCNA Labs** repository! 
I am currently at the beginning of my journey to learn Computer Networks and study for the CCNA certification. This repository serves as a personal log to document my progress, store my Packet Tracer files, and save the basic configuration commands I learn along the way.

The goal is to build my practical skills step by step, going from the absolute basics to more advanced routing and switching concepts.

## 🛠️ Current Focus & Skills (Updating as I learn)
Since I am just starting out, my current labs focus on the fundamentals:
* **Tools:** Cisco Packet Tracer
* **Basics:** Navigating Cisco IOS, setting hostnames, and basic security (passwords).
* **Connectivity:** IP Addressing, Subnetting basics, and testing connections using `ping`.
*(This section will grow as I learn about VLANs, Routing Protocols, etc.)*
